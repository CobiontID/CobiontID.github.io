Try exploring the data interactively here:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CobiontID/CobiontID.github.io/blob/main/Readviz_demo.ipynb)

The simplest way to run the notebook is to click on `Runtime -> Run all` and then scroll down to interact with the plot. For example, you may draw a rectangular selection and run blast to find out what is in the cluster at the bottom with high coding density.

You might also be interested in reads with k-mer coverage >= 1000 - notice the mitochondrion in the selection.
