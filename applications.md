# Genomics of endosymbionts
A comprehensive survey of [Wolbachia](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001972) genomes found in insects sampled by the Darwin Tree of Life project is based on the Marker Scan approach.

In addition to helping to generate reference-quality bacterial assemblies, the toolkit is proving useful to extract sequences from microsporidians.
